Once upon a time there was a creature named Johnny. Johnny lived alone in a cave deep in the forest. There was nothing except ghouls and ghosts living in the forest with him. He had rarely seen a human being in his several hundread years of life. 

Then one day as he was walking through the forest among the ghouls he saw something he hasn't seen for a while, a person. Unlike the ghouls he did not lumber around and bumb into things. It was so strange for him to see a person.
