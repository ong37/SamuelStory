Once upon a time there was a creature named Johnny. Johnny lived alone in a cave deep in the forest. There was nothing except ghouls and ghosts living in the forest with him. He had rarely seen a human being in his several hundread years of life. 

Then one day as he was walking through the forest among the ghouls he saw something he hasn't seen for a while, a person. Unlike the ghouls he did not lumber around and bumb into things. It was so strange for him to see a person.

He really want to talk with that person, but he has almost forgotten how to communicate with human. So he diceded to do something to attract the person's attention.

He passed through the human. He was able to do so as he is a ghost. But, sadly, the human still not noticed that Johnny has been passed through the human's body. After he failed to communcate with the human being, Johnny decided to learn how to speak human's language.

Johnny spent the next few minutes learning the human's language. When he felt confident enough to speak, he approached the human and started speaking. The human was spooked by the noise coming from the forest and ran away. Johnny was back to being alone in the forest.
